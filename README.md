# Do I Do It

this is just a simple python code that runs using the random module!

## Getting Started

To download the code you do it directly from github or copy the code and the paste it in your code editing software to edit it or add your personal touches!

### Prerequisites

You will not need to download any module or package since the random module comes pre installed with python, so you will only need the latest version of python on the path you'll be using!
